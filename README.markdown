## About
TVShowsWin is the easiest way to download your favorite shows automatically.

No actual videos are downloaded by TVShows, only torrents which require other programs to use. It is up to the user to decide the legality of using any files downloaded by this application, in accordance with applicable copyright laws of their country.
